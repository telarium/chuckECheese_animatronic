</p>

This project is for a retrofit of an old 1981 Cyberanimc Animatronic from Pizza Time Theatre, better known as Chuck E. Cheese's band. A Raspberry Pi was used with a custom circuit board to control the animatronic, adding voice recognition and AI capabilities. Features include:

* Wifi control through an HTML interface
* Voice recognition with wakeword detection
* Speech-to-text support
* Intent detection for pre-defined commands
* Integration with ChatGPT or DeepSeek
* Text-to-speech for offline mode or online mode with Elevenlabs for natural sounding speech
* Wireless gamepad support
* Wifi management, including access point mode (hotspot)
* MIDI support for animating new shows
